# Flight_Booking_Agent
The proposed solution is an Agentic AI–powered Flight Booking System that leverages autonomous, goal-driven intelligent agents to manage the complete flight booking lifecycle. The system interprets user intent using natural language understanding, orchestrates multiple specialized agents to perform real-time flight search, price comparison, and constraint-based reasoning, and delivers personalized recommendations. A supervisory agent coordinates worker agents to handle dynamic pricing, availability validation, and booking execution while ensuring fault tolerance and consistency. Deployed using a scalable microservices architecture, the solution ensures high reliability, transparency, and an optimized booking experience with minimal human intervention.
